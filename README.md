**Virtual Machine Management System**

The Virtual Machine Management System is a Python program built using the PyMongo library, designed to facilitate the management of virtual machines (VMs) within a computing environment. This system empowers users to perform essential VM operations such as creating, deleting, modifying, and displaying VMs, all while seamlessly storing and retrieving data from a MongoDB server.

**Features**

**Create VM:** Users can create new virtual machines by specifying necessary parameters such as name, configuration, and resource allocation.

**Delete VM:** The system allows users to remove existing VMs from the environment, ensuring efficient resource management.

**Modify VM:** Users have the flexibility to update the configurations or properties of existing VMs to adapt to changing requirements.

**Display VMs:** The program offers the capability to view a list of all available VMs, providing transparency and oversight into the current virtual infrastructure.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

The Virtual Machine Management System has been developed following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring robustness, reliability, and maintainability of the codebase. Through TDD, comprehensive test suites have been created to validate the functionality of each component of the program. This proactive testing methodology not only guarantees the correctness of the code but also facilitates future enhancements and modifications with confidence.

**Usage**

To utilize the Virtual Machine Management System, ensure that Python and PyMongo are installed on your system. Additionally, make sure to have access to a MongoDB server for data storage. Follow the instructions provided in the program documentation to configure the connection to the MongoDB server and execute the desired VM management operations.
